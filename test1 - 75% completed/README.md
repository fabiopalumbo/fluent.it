**Test 1 - Kubernetes, Ansible, Python and Vagrant**
As developer, I want to launch a local Kubernetes development environment automatically. I expect to create my environment running"vagrant up", and after that I must be able to login into the Vagrant VM and run kubectl commands.
Include a simple Python script that list all the running pods in all the namespaces. Call this script at the end of "vagrant up or provision" process to validate Kubernetes installation. 
Publish your code in a public GitHub repository, and share a Pull Request with your code. Do not merge into master until the PR is approved.
Include documentation describing the steps to run and test the automation.

**Introduction to Vagrant**
Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.

**Ansible** is an open-source IT automation engine, which can remove drudgery from your work life, and will also dramatically improve the scalability, consistency, and reliability of your IT environment.
