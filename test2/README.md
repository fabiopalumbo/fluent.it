Test 2 - AWS, Terraform and Kitchen
Create Terraform code to create a AWS S3 bucket with two files: test1.txt and test2.txt. The content of this files must be the timestamp when the code was executed.
Using Kitchen Terraform, create the script to automate the testing for the Terraform code, validating that both files and the bucket are created successfully.
Publish your code in a public GitHub repository, and share a Pull Request with your code. Do not merge into master until the PR is approved.
Include documentation describing the steps to run and test the automation.
