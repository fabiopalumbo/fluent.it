Test 1 - Kubernetes, Ansible, Python and Vagrant
As developer, I want to launch a local Kubernetes development environment automatically. I expect to create my environment running"vagrant up", and after that I must be able to login into the Vagrant VM and run kubectl commands.
Include a simple Python script that list all the running pods in all the namespaces. Call this script at the end of "vagrant up or provision" process to validate Kubernetes installation. 
Publish your code in a public GitHub repository, and share a Pull Request with your code. Do not merge into master until the PR is approved.
Include documentation describing the steps to run and test the automation.
